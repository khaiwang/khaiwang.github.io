Hi! Welcome to my website.

My name is Zikai Wang. I am a 2nd year PhD student in Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, advised by Prof. [Cheng Tan](https://naizhengtan.github.io/). I am a member of the [System Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu/), where I work on building reliable and verifiable data systems. I am a member of the [NDIF](https://ndif.us/) team now, developing scalable large neural networks serving and optimizing inference engines for efficient model auditing.

Before Northeastern, I obtained my M.E and B.E in Renmin University of China (RUC) under the supervision of Prof. Yunpeng Chai. Where I worked on the distributed database system.

##### Research Experience
+ Graduate Research Assistant, Northeastern University
    - Sep 2024 - present
    - Advisor: Prof. [Cheng Tan](https://naizhengtan.github.io/).
    - Working on reliable and verifiable data systems
+ Research Intern, Microsoft Research Asia
    - May 2024 - Aug 2024
    - Advisor: Qianxi Zhang, Baotong Lu
    - Working on the robustness of vector index. We proposed a metric **robustness** to measure the recall distribution of vector indices, and provided index selection and tuning guidelines for applications relying on vector indices like Retrieval-Augmented Generation based on the **robusntess** metric.
+ Research Intern, TU Darmstadt
    - Mar 2023 - May 2024
    - Advisor: Prof. [Carsten Binnig](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/systems/systems_tuda/group/team_detail_18624.en.jsp), Dr. [Tobias Ziegler](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/systems/systems_tuda/group/team_detail_18944.en.jsp)
    - Working on the scalable transactional database system above disaggregated shared-caching system.
+ Research Intern, Tencent
    - Sep 2020 - Sep 2022
    - Working on the distributed database system. I provided heterogeneous multiple replicas supports for TDSQL3, a commercial distributed HTAP database in C++ developed by Tencent. I proposed a workload-aware storage model based on the key-value storage engine of TDSQL3.
+ Research Intern, Renmin University of China
    - Sep 2019 - Sep 2020
    - Advisor: Prof. Yunpeng Chai, Dr. [Yangyang Wang](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/professor/YangyangWang)
    - Working on optimizing the distributed consensus protocol for distributed key-value stores.
